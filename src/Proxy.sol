 * @title Proxy contract
 * @notice This contract is created and paired with every contest in SPARKN.
 * This disposable contract is supposed to be used during the contest's life cycle.
 * After the contest is over, this contract will not be used anymore.
 * In case somebody may send token to this contract by mistake, we added a function
 * in Distributor contract to distribute the token after the contest is over.
 * @dev This contract is the proxy contract which will be deployed by factory contract.
 * This contract is based on OpenZeppelin's Proxy contract.
 * This contract is designed to be with minimal logic in it and in this way,
 * it can prevent functions' signature collision.
